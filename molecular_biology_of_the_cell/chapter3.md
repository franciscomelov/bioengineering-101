# Chapter 3: Proteins

## Notes
- Proteins constitute most of the cell's dry mass and execute most of the cell's functions.
- Proteins are chemically the most structurally complex and functionally sophisticated molecules known.
- There are 20 different amino acids, and each has different chemical properties.
- Proteins can also be known as polypeptides.
- The repeating sequence of atoms at the core of the polypeptide chain is the polypeptide backbone. The portions of the amino acids not in the backbone give the structure its unique properties.
- Many weak bonds acting in parallel can act together to hold two regions of a polypeptide chain tightly together.
- The hydrophobic amino acids tend to cluster towards the inside of the molecule while the polar molecules arrange themselves on the outside of the molecule.
- The final folded structure of the protein or molecule, is generally the one that minimizes free energy.
- Proteins often spontaneously refold, or renature.
- Molecular chaperones assist in protein folding.
- Most proteins are between 50 and 2000 amino acids long.
- The cores of many proteins consist of many extensive regions of beta-sheet.
- An alpha helix is generated when a single polypeptide chain twists around itself in a rigid cylinder.
- There are four layers of structure to a protein.
    1. The amino acid sequence is the primary structure.
    2. alpha helicies and beta sheets create the secondary structure.
    3. The fully folded sequence is the tertiary structure.
    4. If multiple chains create a protein that is the quarternary structure.
- A **protein domain** is a substructure of a protein that folds independently and is prevalent in many proteins.
- The smallest proteins are a single protein domain, while other are multiple protein domains. Amino acids can act as flexible structures between different protein domains.
- 20^n different polypeptide chains are possible in a chain n amino acids long.
- Many similar examples show that proteins with 25% similarity in amino acid composition share the overall same structure.
- The human genome contains about 21,000 protein-coding genes.
- Over 66% of proteins consist of two or more domains.
- Any region of a protein's surface that can interact with another molecule through noncovalent bonds is called a **binding site**.
- A **globular protein** is a protein that folds up into a ball shape with an irregular surface.
- An **actin filament** is a long helical structure produced from many molecules of the protein actin.
- Fibrous proteins are abundant outside the cell in the extracellular matrix, where these can form organs.
- Elastin is an example of a highly elastic and disordered protein.
- Not all cellular structures held together by non-covalent bonds self-assemble.
- There are assembly factors that can take part in protein construction but are not present in the final structure.
- There are self-propagating beta sheet aggregates called amyloid fibrils. These can contribute to disease.
- A protein molecule's amino acid sequence contributes to its 3D conformation.
- Hyrdophobic side chains tend to cluster on the inside of the molecules, and hydrogen bonds between peptides give rise to beta sheets and alpha helixes.
- All proteins bind to other molecules. The binding shows great specificity.
- Not all proteins are capable of spontaneously refolding themselves, as some proteins require external assembly factors.
- The substrate that is bound by a proteins is called a **ligand** for that protein.
- The region of the protein that interacts with a ligand is called the ligand's **binding site**.
- A protein can keep a ligand's binding site dry due to water's surface tension.
- Two alpha helices from different proteins can coil together to form a coiled-coil.
- The most common way for proteins to interact is the rigid surfaces binding together.
- Antibodies are proteins known as **immunoglobulins**.
- Enzymes work in teams, with the product of one enzyme becoming the substrate for the next.
- Some enzymes are so efficient they cannot be improved, these reactions are then diffusion limited.
- Intracellular membranes can increase the concentration of substrates and improve the efficiency of enzymatic reactions.
- Feedback inhibition can exist when a product binds to an enzyme to slow down the reaction.
- Enzymes can also be subject to positive regulation when a product increases the reaction rate.
- Protein's function can also be regulated by covalent addition of another protein to the protein's sidechain.
- Ubiquitin is a protein that can be covalently attached to other proteins sidechains and therefore determine their fate in the cell.
- Cells contain ubiquilating and deubiquilating enzymes.
- **Proteomics** is a term used to describe research on a large set of proteins.
- For many genes, RNA is the final product.
- The roles of many non-coding RNAs are not yet known.
