# Chapter 1: Cells and Genomes

## Notes
This is a list of things I found notable about this chapter. Note that there may be other important information in the chapter, but so far I have only included things that I didn't know about from other places. I accept issues and merge requests if you feel other things should be included.

- Portions of translation seem relatively arbitrary in the sense that they are identical in all living things. These are considered frozen accidents because they stem from chance properties of early organisms that were passed on by heredity. They are now so deeply integrated as a feature of all living cells that they cannot be changed without disastrous unintended consequences.
- Cells exist far from chemical equilibrium. Cell growth and reproduction requires that the cell constantly take in materials and free energy from the environment. As a cell trends towards chemical equilibrium, it dies.
- Mycoplasma genitalium has one of the smallest known and sequenced genomes of all living organisms. Its genome contains about 530 genes, of which about 400 are essential.
- The minimal number of genes for a cell in today's environment is probably not less than 300.
- About 60 genes exist in the core set shared by all living species.
- Microorganisms make up most of the total living biomass of the planet.
- DNA, RNA, and proteins are composed only of 6 elements. These are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
- In order for nitrogen to become available to the cell, it must exist in an organic compound that is consumable by the cell. To turn atmospheric nitrogen into an organic compound containing nitrogen is called “nitrogen fixing”. Many cells are incapable of fixing nitrogen on their own, so they rely on other cells to produce usable nitrogen products.
- The two groups of prokaryotes are archaea and bacteria.
- Parts of the DNA that do not code for proteins change more easily throughout evolution.
- Most prokaryotic genomes consist of between 1000 and 6000 genes.
- Viruses are small packets of genetic material that have evolved as parasites on the reproductive and biosynthetic mechanisms of other cells. Virii serve as vectors of gene transfer.
- 63 gene families are truly ubiquitous across all genomes that have been fully sequenced.
- The human race knows more about the molecular biology of  E. coli than it does of any other living organism.
- Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome.
- Fungal cells have mitochondria, but not chloroplasts, but also have a cell wall.
- The genomes of eukaryotes have mostly become orders of magnitude larger than that of prokaryotes.
- A popular choice for genetic analysis of eukaryotes is the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast is a single celled fungi and is closely related to both animals and plants. It has an exceptionally small genome for a eukaryote.
- A worm, fly, fish, mouse, and the human make up the 5 model organisms that humans have most extensively studied with regards to molecular biology.

## Glossary
Here are some important words from the chapter

- **Monomer** - component of a polymer, in DNA, nucleotides with nicknames A, C, T, G
- **Nucleotide** - a Monomer consisting of sugar with a phosphate group attached and a base (A, T, C, G)
- **DNA** - Deoxyribonucleic Acid
- **mRNA** - (messenger RNA) the result of DNA transcription, used to guide the synthesis of proteins
- **RNA** - Ribonucleic Acid
- **Codon** - a triplet of nucleotides that specifies a single amino acid in a corresponding protein. There are 4 possible nucleotides, so 4^3=64 possible codons that code for 20 possible amino acids.
- **tRNA** - (transfer RNA) becomes attached to a specific amino acid and contains an anticodon
- **Polypeptide** - a molecule created by joining polypeptides in a particular sequence
- **Enzymes** - polymers that catalyze reactions to make or break covalent bonds
- **Protein** - long unbranched polymer chain
- **Gene** - a DNA segment that codes for a specific protein
- **Genome** - The totality of the Genetic information as embodied in the complete DNA sequence of a cell
- **ATP** - (Adenosine Triphosphate) carrier of free energy that drives a huge number of the chemical reactions in the cell.
- **Plasma membrane** - a container that acts as a selective barrier that enables a cell to concentrate nutrients gathered from the environment as well as eliminate waste
- **Amphiphilic** - containing one part hydrophilic material and one part hydrophobic material
- **Organotrophic** - deriving energy by feeding on other organisms
- **Phototrophic** - feeding on sunlight
- **Lithotrophic** - feeding on rock
- **Aerobic** - requiring molecular oxygen
- **Anaerobic** - not requiring molecular oxygen
- **Eukaryotes** - organisms that keep DNA in an intracellular compartment called the nucleus
- **Prokaryotes** - organisms that have no nucleus to house DNA
- **Orthologs** - Genes that are related by ancestry, but have diverged in sister organisms while retaining similar functions
- **Paralogs** - genes in sister species that comes from the same ancestral gene, but have diverged in function
- **Homologs** - orthologs or paralogs
- **Gene family** - a set of several similar genes, formed by duplication of single original gene and generally have similar biochemical functions
- **Viruses** - small packets of genetic material that are parasites on reproductive and biosynthetic machinery of host cells
- **Plasmid** - an intracellular fragment of DNA
- **Model organism** - a non-human species extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena
