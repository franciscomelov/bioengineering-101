# Chapter 2: Cell Chemistry and Bioenergetics

## Notes
- 06.5% of an organism's weight consists of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
- Noncovalent bonds are weaker than covalent bonds.
- Molecules, such as alcohols, that contain polar bonds and that can form  hydrogen bonds with water dissolve readily in water. Molecules carrying charges (ions) likewise interact favorably with water. Such molecules are termed hydrophilic.
- Much of biology depends on the specific binding of different molecules caused by  three types of noncovalent bonds: electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds), hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals attractions; and on a fourth factor that can push  molecules together: the hydrophobic force.
- Although each individual noncovalent attraction would be much too weak to be effective in the face of thermal motions, their energies can sum to create a strong force between two separate molecules.
- Substances that release protons when they dissolve in water, thus forming  H3O+, are termed acids.
- The opposite of an acid is a base. Any molecule capable of accepting a proton  from a water molecule is called a base.
- Many biologically important molecules contain an amino (NH2) group. This group is a weak base that can generate OH– by taking a proton from water.
- The cell uses buffers to keep the environment of the cell relatively constant
under a variety of conditions.
- If we disregard water and inorganic ions such as potassium, nearly all the molecules in a cell are based on carbon.
- The following chemical groups occur repeatedly in the molecules made by cells:
  - methyl (-CH3)
  - hydroxyl (-OH)
  - carboxyl (-COOH)
  - carbonyl (-C=O)
  - phosphate (-PO3(2-))
  - sulfhydrl (-SH)
  - amino (-NH2)
- There are four main categories of organic molecules
  - sugars
  - fatty acids
  - nucleotides
  - amino acids
- Each polymer, whether it is a protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide, grows by the addition of a monomer to a growing
chain via a condensation reaction.
- The noncovalent bonds in a polymer tend to cause specific polymers to prefer
a specific configuration.
- Noncovalent bonds can also create a strong attraction between two different molecules.
- Diffusion is an efficient way for small molecules to move the limited distances in the cell.
- One property of living things above all makes them seem almost miraculously different from nonliving matter: they create and maintain order, in a universe that is tending always to greater disorder. To create this order, the cells in  a living organism must perform a never-ending stream of chemical reactions.
- The chemical reactions that a cell carries out would normally occur only at much  higher temperatures than those existing inside cells. The cell uses catalysts to perform chemical reactions at lower temperatures.
- The second law of thermodynamics states that the degree of disorder in the universe or in an isolated system is always increasing.
- Entropy is used to quantify the amount of disorder in a system.
- A cell maintains order by increasing the entropy of its surroundings.
- Chemical reactions proceed spontaneously only in the direction that leads to a loss of free energy.
- An enzyme cannot change the equilibrium point for a reaction.
- ∆G depends not only on the energy stored in each individual molecule, but also on the concentrations of the molecules in the reaction  mixture.
- Unfavorable reactions can be coupled to favorable ones to drive the unfavorable ones forward.
- The energy released by the oxidation of food molecules must be stored temporarily before it can be channeled into the construction of the many other molecules needed by the cell.
- The most important activated carriers are ATP, NADH, and NADPH.
- The synthesis of biological polymers is driven by ATP hydrolysis.
- The major process for oxidizing sugars is the sequence of reactions known as  glycolysis—from the Greek glukus, “sweet,” and lusis, “rupture.” Glycolysis produces ATP without the involvement of molecular oxygen (O2 gas).
- To compensate for long periods of fasting, animals store fatty acids as fat droplets composed of water-insoluble triacylglycerols
- Quantitatively, fat is far more important than glycogen as an energy store for  animals, presumably because it provides for more efficient storage.
- In the nineteenth century, biologists noticed that in the absence of air cells produce lactic acid (for example, in muscle) or ethanol (for example, in yeast), while  in its presence they consume O2 and produce CO2 and H2 O.

## Glossary
- **Covalent Bond** - a chemical bond that involves the sharing of an electron
between atoms.
- **Hydrogen Bond** - a weak bond between two molecules resulting from an
electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an
electronegative atom in another molecule.

hydrogen atoms in a solution.
- **Alkaline** - having a pH greater than 7.
