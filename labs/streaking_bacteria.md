# Streaking Bacteria
- DNA needs to be stored in the freezer.
- A stab is a little bit of agar with bacteria in it.
- Lab procedure
    1. Apply gloves.
    2. Use innoculation loop, the large loop may not be able to properly fit into the cryotube.
    3. Stab the stab with the loop, pull out slowly and streak it with the surface across the agar.
- Streak the bacteria lightly to make single colonies.
- Colonies may be told apart by their morphology.
- You can use 10% bleach to sanitize the loops afterwards.
