# Making Agar Plates

Prepare your workspace with
- 5 to 8 petri dishes
- Glass bottle
- LB Agar Mix (35g/L)
- Scale
- Weighing Dish
- Fluid measuring unit

## Steps
1. Put on gloves. Sterilize gloves with alcohol (>%70). Sterilize scale and outside of glass bottle.
2. Put weighing dish on scale and tear. Weigh 4.37g of LB agar.
3. Put agar in glass bottle. Measure 125mL of water (I used tap water) and pour it into glass bottle.
4. Screw the lid on the glass bottle and shake mixture. Mixture will be cloudy at this point.
5. Unscrew lid from glass bottle and just place lid on top of bottle without screwing it on. **IF YOU DO NOT UNSCREW THE LID IT WILL EXPLODE IN THE MICROWAVE.**
6. Place the glass bottle with the agar solution in the microwave with a paper towel underneath it.
Microwave the agar solution for 6 to 10 seconds at a time constantly watching the solution to make sure it does not boil over.
If it boils over, stop the microwave and wait for 30 seconds and then continue. Repeat until there is no more sediment in the solution.
7. Once the solution is translucent, let it sit for 30 mins, or until you can comfortable handle the bottle.
8. Once you can handle the bottle, open a petri dish. Pour the agar solution into the bottom section (smaller diameter) of the petri dish until it is half full. Place the lid back on the petri dish. Try to be as sterile as possible so as not to contaminate the agar or petri dish with bacteria.
9. Fill between 5 to 8 dishes.
10. Let the agar cool in the dishes (about half an hour). Once the dishes appear solid, flip the dishes upside down so that when condensation forms it does not form on the agar.
11. Ideally let them sit out for a day to let condensation dissipate, and then put them in the fridge, or the are ready to use right away. (??? I just read this idk for sure.)
