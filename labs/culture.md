# Culture Lab
I interpreted this as a make-your-own-experiment kind of lab. The finger and glove and handwashing idea was cool,
but I've been having some bacteria and mold problems in my apartment with my shower and sink
and also when trying to make rice wine so I figured I would do some water cultures instead.

I wanted to culture tap water, brita filtered water (what I drink), and boiled tap water.
Also its worth noting that I live in Newark so my water is probably riddled with lead, but
I can't culture lead so w/e.

Anyways this is the experiment I designed. I don't know if its the best or not.

## Equipment
- Nitrile Gloves
- 5 agar plates
- 3 fluid containers with lid
- Glass bottle
- 100uL to 1000uL pipette and tips
- 0.5uL to 10uL pipette and tips
- 3 micro centrifuge tubes
- 3 inoculation loops
- Sharpie

## Steps
0. Put on gloves. Sanitize gloves with ethanol (>70%). Sanitize brain with ethanol (5-20%).
1. Sanitize fluid containers with 70% ethanol. Allow to evaporate on a sterile surface.
2. Fill container with 50mL Tap water, and another with 50 mL filtered water. Seal.
3. Add at least 50mL water to glass bottle. Place lid on bottle, but leave unscrewed. **DO NOT SCREW THE LID ON OR THE BOTTLE WILL EXPLODE AND YOU MAY END UP ON DARWIN AWARDS BECAUSE I SAW SOMEONE ON THERE WHO MICROWAVED A LAVA LAMP :(** Microwave in microwave for 6-10 seconds at a time until water boils.
4. Allow water to cool until you can safely handle it. Pour into third container and seal.
5. Use the 1000uL pipette to pipette 900uL of each of the three samples into a centrifuge tube and seal.
6. Using the sharpie separate the bottom plate of 4 petri dishes into two halves. Two should be "tap" and "filtered" and two should be "boiled" and "control". On the fifth separate into quadrants and label "T", "F", "B", and "C".
7. Using a separate inoculation loop for each sample, inoculate the samples on each halved petri dish using the fluid in the centrifuge tubes.
8. On the fifth petri dish with the quadrants, pipette 10uL of each fluid into the proper quadrant using a fresh tip for each sample.
9. Store the petri dishes upside down at room temperature for 48 hours.

## Results
Not sure, just did this now. Waiting on results.
