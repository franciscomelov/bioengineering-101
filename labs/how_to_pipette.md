# How to Pipette

## General Notes
- Keep the pipette away from the bottom of the vessel.
- Air bubbles can decrease accuracy.
- Use the large volume on the pipetter to identify the correct pipette tip.
- A thumb plunger has three states:
  - Resting
  - Measurement (light stopping pressure, not fully depressed)
  - Full Discharge (fully depressed)
- To adjust the measurement, rotate the plunger clockwise (increase measurement) or counter-clockwise (decrease measurement).
- Retrieve tip from box using pipetter, avoiding contamination. Do not press to hard, it should be easy to put tip on.
- Push pipetter into medium slowly to avoid bubbles and depress plunger slowly to avoid bubbles.
- Check pipette tip for bubbles before transferring.
- Depress fully to transfer.
- Hold pipetter at 90 degress to extract, and at an angle to dispense to avoid splash.
- Press the tip ejector to eject tip.

## To asperate
- Hold perpendicular to the liquid you are pipetting.
- Press to the first stop.
- Slowly insert tip into liquid, far enough, but not too far. Do not put it along the edge of the vessel or contact the bottom.
- Release plunger slowly. Press to 1st stop and release slowly 2 or 3 more times.
- Release the plunger slowly and remove from liquid.

## To dispense fluid
- Hold pipette tip against receiving vessel wall at 25 to 40 degree angle.
- Slowly press to 1st stop. Hold there for a second.
- Depress plunger fully and remove pipette.
- Use tip remover button to remove tip.

## Observations
- When dispensing, waiting between the 1st stop and fully depressed makes a huge difference.
- When asperating, drawing and releasing the fluid 2 to 3 times makes a huge difference.
