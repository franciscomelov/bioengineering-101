# How to Pipette

- Keep the pipette away from the bottom of the vessel.
- Air bubbles can decrease accuracy.
- Use the large volume on the pipetter to identify the correct pipette tip.
- A thumb plunger has three states:
  - Resting
  - Measurement (light stopping pressure, not fully depressed)
  - Full Discharge (fully depressed)
- To adjust the measurement, rotate the plunger clockwise (increase measurement) or counter-clockwise (decrease measurement).
- Retrieve tip from box using pipetter, avoiding contamination. Do not press to hard, it should be easy to put tip on.
- Push pipetter into medium slowly to avoid bubbles and depress plunger slowly to avoid bubbles.
- Check pipette tip for bubbles before transferring.
- Depress fully to transfer.
- Hold pipetter at 90 degress to extract, and at an angle to dispense to avoid splash.
- Press the tip ejector to eject tip.
