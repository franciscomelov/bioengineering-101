# Week 3
- Protiens are what makes everything alive.
- Proteins can absorb light, emite light, break down chemicals (enzymes).
- Proteins can bind other molecules.
- Protiens cannot emit radiation, unless possibly they bound to or contained a raidoactive element.
- Radioactivity exists on a different layer of abstraction than proteins.
- Protiens are composed of up to 20 unique amino acids.
- Biological systems are sloppy and messy.
- Protiens can be post-translationally modified (i.e. sugars added after translation)
- A gene tells a cell it wants to make a protein.
- DNA is transcirbed into RAN, RNA is translated into protein.
- DNA is more stable than RNA.
- The cell contains RNAases that are constantly destroying RNA.
- Each sequence of 3 bases in DNA codes for a single amino acid (codon).
- There is a stop codon at the end of a gene.
- A good resource to find protiens is the NCBI database.
- We can't predict how proteins will fold with a great amount of accuracy.
- Protiens have multiple degress of reedom so they can fold in many ways.
- RCSB lets you look at the 3D strucutre (rcsb.org).
- The VMD program lets you look at molecules.
- Amino acid polymers spontaneously fold into proteins.
- The function of a protein depends on the geometry and chemical properties of the protein.
