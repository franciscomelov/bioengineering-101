# Week 2
- Stem cells can be multipotent, pluripotent, or totipotent.
- Totipotent means they can differentiate into any kind of cell.
- Scientists used to only be able to get stem cells using embryos.
- 24 genes were involved in stem cell "identity".
- A stem cell is a state of a cell.
- A stem cell may look to similar to a somatic cell to differentiate based on
vision alone.
- G418 is a toxin, it is an antibiotic and antimycotic.
- If cells are stem cells, they will be resistant to G418.
- When you put 24 "identity" genes into somatic cells, you can induce stem cell state.
- PCR makes many copies, amplifies, DNA.
- rtPCR is PCR using RNA.
- Both somatic cells and stem cells have the same genes, but epigenetics modifies expression.
- Microarray is a glass slide w/ microscopic dots w/ DNA attached. The slide is washed in DNA and it will bind to matching DNA.
- 23 and me uses microarray, it does not sequence the genome.
- Teratomas are gross.
