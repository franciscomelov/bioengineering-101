# Week 2: Guest Lecture

- Synthetic cells would allow us to understand the entirety of how that particular cell operates.
- "What I cannot build, I cannot understand" - Feynman.
- We need to make more kinds of life so we can understand what life could be.
- We don't have an agreed upon definition of what a synthetic cell is yet.
- Genes must be transcribed and translated in some kind of compartment to have a synthetic cell.
- The protein expression system is an important facet of building synthetic cells.
- Cells regulate when genes are expressed and at what levels.
- SYN 3.0 (a synthetic cell) is made from living cells.
- **ALIENS ARE PROBABLY DEAD.**
- Under certain physical and chemical conditions, life is inevitable.
- The origin of life is quick on a geological timescale.
- The guest lecturer believes in 10 years we may have evolving synthetic cells.
- Synthetic cells might be replicating instead of self-replicating.
- E. coli doesn't have a lifespan. E. coli doesn't die of old age, they just divide or die from horrific accidents.
- Synthetic cells can die of old age. This currently happens in 2 to 4 days unless we give them fresh ribosomes.
