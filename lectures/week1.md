# Week 1

## Syllabus Review
- Join Facebook Group
- Read the Read Me First First
- Have to read to learn
- Programs
  - Snap Gene
  - VMD(?)
- Drink whiskey and beer at the same time
- Goal of the class is to be able to design genetic experiments and CRISPR experiments with one beer and one scotch in hand.

## Cells
- Cells are self-replication, engineer-able matter.
- Cells only come from other cells.
- Yeast, bacteria, and mammalians cells are easier to engineer.
- Fungi are harder to engineer due to the cell wall. You would need to use an enzyme
to break down the cell wall.
- Somatic cell nuclear transfer is swapping the nuclear contents of the cell.
- Many antibiotics are antivirals stop cells from replicating, they may not actually "kill" the cell.
- All cells have DNA and replicate their DNA in the same way.
- All CRISPR does is cut DNA. Cell's natural machinery is what puts it back together.
- Bacteria (gram negative or gram positive), yeast cells, fungi, mammalian cells, are just a few different kinds of cells.
- Proteins make cells alive.
- Viruses can't replicate on their won and aren't really alive.
- Bacteria and yeast are the easiest to engineer.
- Genome size is not correlated with complexity.
- Model organisms are bullshit, and do not reflect what is possible in other orgranisms.
- Almost everything in cells is H, C, O, P, S, or N so you can grow cells in the presence of sugar and amino acids.

## Experiments
- Pipettes pipe up liquid.
- Most of molecular biology is moving one liquid into another.
- Hold pipette at 90 degress.
- Grab pipette tip using pipette out of container.
- You don't need to press hard to add pipette tip.
- Setting the right amount to pipette is important.
- Practice pipetting the same thing a large number of times.
- You can crank down the pipette volume as a hack to get stubborn fluids out of the pipette tip.
- Clean pipette with 70% alcohol if you clean it.
- Cleaning the pipette can make it less accurate.

## Plates
- Microwave agar in 10 second increments.
- Don't screw the lid on when you microwave the glass bottle or it will explode.
- Microwave until it is completely dissolved and not cloudy. It should be clear.
- Watch while microwaving so it does not boil over.
- Don't let the agar solidify in the bottle.
- An agar plate has a top and a bottom.
- Fill the bottom plate w/ agar to halfway point.
- If the agar is poured too thin it will dry out and the culture will die.
- If you open the agar plate in the air it will become unsterile.
- Don't shake the agar a lot as this could cause bubbles.
- Bubbles in the agar make the plate unclear to see.
- You can gently sift bubbles out of the cooling agar or use the pipette tip to pop them.
- Leave the plate out until it has solidified.
- Label all plates, and label them on the bottom plate.
- An example label is: "LB Medium, E. coli, 12/12/19".
- Store plates upside down, this will prevent condensation from killing the culture.
- Use ethanol to take permanent marker off of plates.
- Use hot soap and water and a toothbrush to clean the agar bottle.
- Wrap plates in aluminum foil or paraffin to decrease probability of bacteria exposure.
- Plates have a shelf life, throw them away if they are contaminated or dry out.
- Antibiotics in antibiotic plates also have a shelf life.
- LB medium is mainly for E. coli.
- Yeast do not grow on LB, but grow on YBD.
- Perform experiments next to an open flame to prevent contamination.
