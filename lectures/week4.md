# Week 4
- If you dissolve a concentrated protein in water and let it dry, you can form protein crystals to use X-ray diffraction on.
- You can literally form protien crystals.
- X-rays diffract off crystals and you can solve the structure of the protein based on the diffraction pattern.
- Proteins are moving and constantly on differnt timescales.
- A protein's states are controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium.
- Some chemicals will unfold a protein.
- ATPase uses ATP to change a protein's structure.
- Some protiens are refoldable, but some denature and are not refoldable.
- When proteins unfold and then integrate with each other in their unfolded states, they cannot return to their normal folded state.
- If a cell is deprived of amino acids it will just die.
- Cells can build some amino acids from scratch.
- Some amino acids are more important than others.
- Some amino acids could substitute other amino acids in function.
- Charged amino acids are irreplacible.
