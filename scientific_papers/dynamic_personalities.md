# Dynamic Personalities of Proteins

## Notes
- Proteins are not static structures, they are soft materials that sample a large ensemble of conformations around the average structure as a result of thermal energy.
- To understand proteins, one must understand the relative probabilities of conformational states and the energy barriers between the states.
- A particular energy landscape is tied to an individul set of temperature, pressure, and solvent conditions.
- A protein's shape might therefore be thought of as a function of the temperature, pressure, and solvent conditions. There may also be other variables.
- An **energy landscape** is a mapping of the possible states of the protein.
- The engergy landscape representing a protein is highly dimensional.
- Manipulating the values of orthogonal dimensions in the protein energy landscape is a way to change the relative populations of the states when multiple proteins are present.
- Tier-0 fluctuations are slow fluctuations between states.
- Transitions between Tier-0 states are rare and improbable.
- A protein state is a minimum in the energy landscape engery surface. A transition state is a maximum.
- Lower-resolution imaging methos provide kinetic information that might not be available to higher-resolution methods.
- Flourescent imaging methods can detect single molecules.
- FRET (flourescense resonance energy transfer) is a mechanism that describes energy transfer between two light sensitive molecules. FRET is extremely sensitive to small changes in distance.
- Computational models of protein dynamics need to be validated experimentally.
- Tier 1 and 2 (fast timescales) operate within the well of a Tier 0 state.
- Tier 1 and 2 contain a large number of states, which require a statistical description.
- Tier 1 is the average 3D strucutre and tiers 1 and 2 represent spatial distribution around this state.
- The B-factor represents mean square atomic displacement.
- X-ray diffraction data contains data about Tier-0, and Tier 1 and 2 states.
- Advances in laser technology allow researchers to examine dynamic on the femptosecond scale.
- Biological function is ultimately rooted in the physical motion of biomolecules.
