## Notes
- Comparative genomics studies genetic similarities between different species.
- The aim of comparative genomics is to provide an understanding of the link between genotype and phenotype.
- Different cells show different patterns of gene expression.
- The amount of DNA or number of genes does not appear to correlate with the complexity of a being. This is illustrated by the G-value paradox.
- Alternative splicing and mRNA editing construct proteins which are not mirroed in linear DNA sequencing.
- Exons are protein coding regions of DNA and introns are non-coding regions of DNA.
- In humans both exons and introns are coded into RNA, but introns are spliced out before mRNA are formed.
- Sometimes preRNAs splice out exons in alternative splicing.
- mRNA editing changes the rpimary mRNA sequence after transcription.
- DNA alone does not lead to the primary structure of a protein.
- There is no linear flow from DNA sequence to product.
