## Notes
- Induced pluripotent cells can be created by introducing a combination of four transcription factors to embryonic and adult fibroblast cells in mice. The four factors are Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.
- Induced pluripotent cells can also be created by transferring the nuclear contents of a somatic cell into oocytes or by fusion with existing stem cells.
- Induced pluripotent cells have the ability to differentiate into all 3 germ layers.
- Cells in a pluripotent state are resistant to G418.

## Glossary
- **ES** - Embryonic Stem (cell)
- **Pluripotency** - the ability to affect more than one organ or tissue
- **Blastocyst** - A structure that forms in the early development that has differentiated into 2 cell types. One cell type for the embryo and the other forms the placenta
- **Somatic Cells** - Cells that form the body cells of an organism. Cells that are not gametes, germ cells, or stem cells
- **Oocyte** - an immature egg or the meiotic precursor to an ovum.
- **Totipotency** - the ability of a cell to divide and differentiate into all of the cells of an organism
- **Transcription factor** - a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA by binding to DNA
- **Homologous recombination** - genetic recombination between two similar or identical molecules of double-stranded DNA
- **Fibroblast** - a cell responsible for making the extracellular matrix
- **Transgene** - a gene that is artificially introduced into the genome of another organism
- **Immunoprecipitation** - precipitating a protein antigen out of  a solution using an antibody that binds to that protein.
- **Teratoma** - a tumor made of several types of tissue, such as hari, muscle, teeth or bone.
- **Trophoblast** - a layer of tissue later forming a major part of the placenta
- **Oncogenes** - a gene which can sometimes transform a cell into a tumor cell
- **Nullipotent** - incapable of developing into a cell type
