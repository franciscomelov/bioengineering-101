## Notes
- No single cellular system has all of its genes understood from a biological role.
- More than 100 of the 485 protein coding genes of *mycoplasma genitalium* are dispensable when disrupted one at a time
- It is possible to create a cell with an entirely synthetic genome that is capable of continuous self-replication.

## Glossary
- **Phage** - a bacteriophage, meaning a virus that infects a bacteria
- **Ovoid** - a three dimensional shape resembling an egg
- **Mycoplasma** - a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall around their membranes.
- **Amplicon** - a piece of DNA that is the source of product of amplification or replication events
